<p>
Do me a favor and read up on the <a href="https://gist.github.com/Rapptz/4a2f62751b9600a31a0d3c78100287f1">discord.py shutdown notice</a><br>
This projects (sonnet-py) future is currently uncertain, and so is the future of many discord bots<br>
What can you do? Spread the word, and protest, protest alot.<br>

<h1>Welcome!</h1>
<p>Sonnet is a modular and multi-function moderation bot for Discord built on top of discord.py and the LeXdPyK runtime environment.</p>
<p>Sonnet's features include but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Kernel based system, load and unload modules at runtime without downtime or reloading the discord cache</li>
	<li>Robust moderation system, infraction logging, powerful automod systems utilizing re2</li>
	<li>Something for the bash users, sonnetsh and map allowing scripting of sonnets own commands</li>
	<li>Complete modularity, load new command modules and event modules with ease and zero downtime</li>
	<li>Written in python, allowing for fast development and expansion</li>
	<li>Fast; internal caching allows for sub milisecond response times</li>
	<li>Intentional simplicity, features that could clog up processing and potentially create buggy behavior are ommited</li>
</ul>
<p>Sonnet comes packaged with 2 extension modules that showcase what is possible with its modularity</p>
<ul>
	<li>Starboard subsystem</li>
	<li>ReactionRoles subsystem</li>
</ul>
<p>Now generated with BHTML :D</p>
