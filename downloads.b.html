<h1>Downloads</h1>
<p>You only need to download the program if you intend to run your own instance of it on your own computer. Running your own instance is encouraged so you have full control of the bot in your guild, but it requires some configuration and the computer it's running on to be turned on all the time. Use a <a href="/instances.html">public instance</a> of Sonnet if you don't want to or can't run your own instance.</p>
<p>If you're running this bot on a large guild, you should choose the current release edition. The development edition is whatever's pushed to the code repository at that moment. It is expected that the dev instance has bugs and it is not the fault of the developers if buggy behavior in the dev instance limits your usage of sonnet, although we will try to keep things patched as soon as they are found, with that in mind please report bugs</p>
<p>IMPORTANT: Read the <a href="/docs/user/setup.html">First Time Setup</a> guide before you do anything.</p>
