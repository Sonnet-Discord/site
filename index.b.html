<h1>Welcome!</h1>
<p>Sonnet is a modular and multi-function moderation bot for Discord built on top of discord.py and the LeXdPyK runtime environment.</p>
<p>Sonnet's features include but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Kernel system; load and unload modules at runtime without downtime or reloading the internal discord cache</li>
	<li>Robust moderation system; infraction logging, extensive automod systems with regex, and easy to use mod commands</li>
	<li>Something for the bash users; sonnetsh and map allowing scripting of sonnets own commands</li>
	<li>Complete modularity; load new command modules and event modules with ease and zero downtime, define new tables in the database for specialized storage</li>
	<li>Written in fully typed python; allowing for fast development and expansion</li>
	<li>Fast; internal caching allows for sub milisecond response times and reduced db load</li>
	<li>Stable; seperating stable and development branches allows for users to have a reliable bot when they need one, or features when they want them</li>
	<li>Updated; sonnet is still recieving updates and new features, ensuring you always have a modern moderation system for your servers needs</li>
	<li>Backwards compatible libraries; adding new features never has to mean breaking old ones, and with sonnet they dont</li>
</ul>
<p>Sonnet comes packaged with 2 extension modules that showcase what is possible with its modularity</p>
<ul>
	<li>Starboard subsystem</li>
	<li>ReactionRoles subsystem</li>
</ul>
<p>Now generated with BHTML :D</p>
